# Marvin (Trello-Twitter Automation)

Marvin the paranoid robot handles taking cards from my "Twitter Automation"
board on Trello and posting them to Twitter.

I can't remember why I named him Marvin. But I do like H2G2, and this seems
like a mind-numbingly boring task, so it's probably somewhere in that line of
thinking.

Anyway, for more information on this project, see [From Trello to Twitter][1].
